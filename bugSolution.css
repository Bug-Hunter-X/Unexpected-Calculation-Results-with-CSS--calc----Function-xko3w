The correct usage of `calc()` in this case would be to remove the unnecessary `px` unit from the percentage value.  The corrected CSS code is shown below:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
  /* Correct usage of calc()*/
  height: calc(50% - 10px); /*This will work correctly*/
}
```

This revised version will accurately calculate the width as 20px less than 100% of the containing element's width.  The `px` unit after `100%` in this context is unnecessary and potentially problematic.
